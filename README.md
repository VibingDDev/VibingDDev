# About me

**VibingDDev/VibingDDev** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.



- 🐟 I’m currently working on a Flappy Bird recreation project (Flappy Fish)
- 🤠 I’m currently learning how to program better, and have a deeper understanding of how code in programs work.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have only been coding for *two months*.
